3.09

Plugin Volume rewritten. Added possibility to use MCI or LBMIX API. Also
added MUTE command

Added keyboard defeinition file (keyboard.def) to allow pmconf work correctly
with special keyboards.

kbdfixd now can call watchcat (undocumented, need to touch this code later)

3.0
First 3.0.
Little changes in pmconf.

3.0a1.
APM plugin added for controling OS/2 power managment.

Added new packet - KBDfix, which allow to correct detection of some keys,
not recognized by PM (see doc)

SemPoster plugin added.

Now win95key create mutex semaphore (\\SEM32\\WIN95KEY\\RUNNING) on startup
and check it on every key event. If it is own by another process win95key
will not process keyboard event. I use it in pmconf to detect key scancodes 
even if they are assigned to events.

Many corrections of pmconf tool. 

Documentation rewritten.

Installation script changed.

Added key-names for "Power", "Sleep" and "WakeUp" keys.

2.3 
The SwitchTo plugin is rewritten. The cyclic switch and template search 
features are added. The templates can be specified even by means of regular 
expressions. For details see help to the SwitchTo plugin in the PmConf tool. 
Thanks to Nick Lepehin for code and Vadim Yegorov for PCRE porting.

The WarpCenterMenu plugin is adapted for correct work under eCS. I can't figure
out why did the authors decide to change the name of the warpcenter but now 
everything should be OK.

2.2 
The plugin SendToPipe is added which allows to send the text defined by user 
to the specified pipe when the predefined key event is activated. This feature 
can be useful for controlling the programs which support pipe control 
(for example Z! MP3 Player).
